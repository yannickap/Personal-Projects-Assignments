# EDA Viz 1, Cost of Living

In my first visualization, “Cost of Living”, I used one measure of the sum of cost index to produce a bar chart that was sorted into descending order. From this I found that other than the territory of Bermuda, the most expensive countries to live in tended to be Western countries. From this I created a map that highlighted the specific regions that may have had higher costs of living, which we can visibly see as North America and Western and Northern Europe.

# EDA Viz 2, Individual country’s corruption and annual income

Next, I produced bar charts that related an individual country’s corruption and annual income. As both were taken as sums on the same axis, I was able to compare how each variable affected the other. First, I visualized how corruption was ranked according to annual income, which showed that countries with higher annual income averages tended to be more free, though there were definitely “outliers” in some respects, for example, countries like the United States, Qatar, and Israel were noticeably some of the richer countries that were more corrupt. From that, I visualized how annual income was ranked according to corruption, in which I found that similarly, the most corrupt countries tended to be poorer, thought it was interesting to point out how some of the most “free” countries in the world were not necessarily “rich” relative to its counterparts, such as Estonia, New Zealand and Portugal.

# EDA Viz 3, Tourism of a country as a percentage of their GDP

My final exploratory visualization came in the form of a treemap, in which I looked at the tourism of a country as a percentage of their GDP. Visually, I found that Macau’s tourism made up 32% of its GDP, followed by countries/territories that you would normally expect such as the Virgin Islands, Italy, and the UAE. This served as an alternative to trying to use the map visualization, since the data from the tourism data file only contained around 40 countries. Since the treemap would fit more data, it makes it more visually appealing for the audience.

# Final Viz 1, Relationship between unemployment rates and corruption

My first visualization looked at the relationship between unemployment rates and corruption. I created two visualization types that overlaid each other, with corruption serving as the bar chart, and unemployment using a line graph. In order to do this, I used the dual axis feature to make a connection between the two. From the visual, it was interesting to see how the trends vary, and it can be argued that corruption does not have an effect on unemployment (corruption set as the descending variable). From the visual, we can see that some of the more corrupt countries do not have “high” unemployment rates (in fact some lower than “freer” countries), and the country with the highest unemployment, South Africa, is in the middle in terms of the freedom index.

# Final Viz 2, GDP and Purchasing Power

My final visualization came in the form of multiple line graphs overlapping each other. Similar to the unemployment/corruption visual, I used dual axes to map the two variables of GDP and Purchasing Power. From this visualization, it is clear to see that GDP and purchasing power are correlated, and that a higher GDP means more purchasing power for a country’s citizens.

One of the biggest limitations was the amount of missing data across files, which included missing countries in certain files, such as the Tourism, which only included 42 countries, with South America, Africa, and Asia missing most or all information. This made it harder to compare across CSV files with smaller datasets that could have been interesting to see. Personally, I found the data in general was quite vague, without  much room to explore factors such as years or the age groups of the population. Finally, the data collected was last updated in 2022, meaning it may only be reflective on statistics during and after the COVID-pandemic, as well as significant events that could greatly impact the variables of the dataset such as wars, natural disasters, etc.
