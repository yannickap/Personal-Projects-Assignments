# Viz 1, Cost of Living

In my first visualization, “Cost of Living”, I used one measure of the sum of cost index to produce a bar chart that was sorted into descending order. From this I found that other than the territory of Bermuda, the most expensive countries to live in tended to be Western countries. From this I created a map that highlighted the specific regions that may have had higher costs of living, which we can visibly see as North America and Western and Northern Europe.
