# Here are some projects I have worked on, both in-class and on my own time. 

# BIOS512
  From my BIOS512 Final in 2023 (listed under 'final_project(1)' in BIOS512 folder), I decided to use my interest in sports to exhibit my use of R packages such as tidyverse, dplyr, and forcats packages to analyze raw data files, organizing, filtering, and analyzing 380 matches from the 2021-2022 Premier League season. I then used different visualization forms of key match statistics from data file.

# INLS541
  For my INLS541 final project in 2024 (listed under 'Analyzing World Economics - Tableau 2024'), I used Tableau to gain insight into predictors that could affect bigger picture economic factors such as GDP. I also visualized economic factors to answer and explain potential cause-and-effect questions.

  From the “World Economic Data'' dataset on Kaggle, we are given 5 csv files named corruption.csv (containing the variables of annual_income and corruption_index), cost of living.csv (containing the variables of cost_index, monthly_income, and purchasing_power), richest_countries.csv (containing gdp_per_capita), tourism.csv (containing tourism_in_millions, receipts_in_billions, receipts_per_tourist, percentage_of_gdp), and unemployment.csv, with unemployment_rate. In my project using Tableau, I created 5 visualizations, the first 3 of them being exploratory with 2 “final” visualizations that related variables to each other. By producing my exploratory data first, I hoped to gain insight into predictors that could affect bigger picture economic factors such as GDP.
