# Personal-Projects-Assignments

Here are some projects I have worked on, both in-class and on my own time. 

BIOS512
From my BIOS512 Final in 2023 (listed under 'final_project(1)' in BIOS512 folder), I decided to use my interest in sports to exhibit my use of R packages such as tidyverse, dplyr, and forcats packages to analyze raw data files, organizing, filtering, and analyzing 380 matches from the 2021-2022 Premier League season. I then used different visualization forms of key match statistics from data file.
